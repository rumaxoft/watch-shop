### ES Modules in Node

We us ECMAScript Modules in the backend in this project. Be sure to have at least Node v14.6+ or you will need to add the "--experimental-modules" flag.

Also, when importing a file (not a package), be sure to add .js at the end or you will get a "module not found" error

You can also install and setup Babel if you would like

### Env Variables

There is an .dev.env file:

```
NODE_ENV = development
PORT = 5050
BASE_URL = http://localhost:8000
API_URL = http://localhost:5050/api
MONGO_USERNAME = 'max'
MONGO_PASSWORD = 1234567
MONGO_PORT = 27017
MONGO_URI = mongodb://max:1234567@localhost:27017
JWT_SECRET = 'abc123'
PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID = your paypal client id
```
